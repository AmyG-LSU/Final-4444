Overview

This project focuses on reading and preparing a five-year dataset, then building two machine-learning models. The repository includes data-loading scripts, model implementations, and organized documentation.

Team Roles
Data Reading & Reporting

Loaded data into Python and generated a brief exploratory report.

Five-Year Period Extraction

Identified the correct five-year window and saved it as a working variable for further analysis.

CatBoost Model

Implemented CatBoost, handled preprocessing, and evaluated model performance.

LSTM Model

Built and trained an LSTM model for sequential predictions.

Repo README & Organization

Managed the GitHub structure, documentation, and overall repository organization.
